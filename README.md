# Laravel Time Management

A basic time manager project originally created using [Laravel 5.8](https://laravel.com/) starting 2016.
This project was one of my first endeavors in Laravel, and probably was the first actual application I started which ran in production for several years.
The code may be a mess, and it may be horribly outdated by today's standards, but it was a great source of knowledge back when I got started with Laravel.

Feel free to use any parts of this project for your own.
